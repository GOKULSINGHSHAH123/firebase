I think we had agreed that for now apart from Omveer we will not have any Samarth folk interact directly with my parents. Lets keep it like that till after we  have Dr. Dhamne recommendations. 

My parents can go to the appointment themselves. Hinduja khar is close to our home.  I was not expecting  anyone to accompany my parents to this appointment.  So please do not postpone it.
