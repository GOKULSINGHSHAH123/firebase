Hopefully, they will remember to turn the AC off during backup power - maybe that is why the bill is so high. Hopefully Cor will use the walker and feel more confident about moving around. You are the Best and Thanks as always!! ",NOT URGENT,2025-06-07T00:22:41.196699+00:00

agenda to check on aunty's well being

Greetings, have met aunty and she is doing fine. On touching her right hand and arm she didn't let me touch and was removing it. Tried doing it several times. She seems to be down so didn't take her for the walk and we were at home listening music.  Su dari mentioned aunty is wating properly and will be serving veggies and chapati for the dinner. Now she is at ease with Sumitra  and  Tulsi being around her to help change the nappy.
Sumitra was on off since her husband called and shared she has terrible stomachache and Sundari managed everything by herself. Thanks ",NOT URGENT,2025-06-07T00:50:06.581907+00:00
