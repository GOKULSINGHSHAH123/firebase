Purpose - Dr Anshul home visit to review urin√© report, collect medical bills for reimbursement, Bank work and eye glass change for aunty 

Uncle called Dr. Anshul to check his urine report, uncle feels a lot of pain while urinating, uncle has infection and for that he has started IV for seven days. After that made a list of medicines to order and checked the medicine stock, Sanjeev is going on leave from 10th for 20 days so uncle wants to order all medicines for a month. Checked uncle's passbook and sent the driver to update the passbook, unfortunately uncle did not get his new passbook and the bank refused to give the statement, then I checked uncle's phone and I got a message of medical reimbursement which was shown to uncle and aunty. In the bank they said they need an application to issue a new passbook, so I told uncle to check once again otherwise I will go to the bank with the application next time.",URGENT,2025-06-06T16:02:55.686759+00:00

Visited aunty and Cor. As soon as i reached AC technician was also there. He thoroughly checked all the Ac's and the main unit for all the Ac's. He first checked with all the ac's on and then checked with only one AC  on. All seemed to be fine. Its that he explained few things to be kept in mind and specially to put off the AC if the main light goes off because if we use AC with back up light the charge is 28 per unit as compared to normal 7 per unit and main unit needs to get serviced too along with AC servicing. 
We also finalised walker. The vendor explained well with a video call. I wrote down all medicines on a paper with bold pen so that even the girl who is working can understand. ",NOT URGENT,2025-06-06T15:24:00.123036+00:00

I met uncle and aunty yesterday and found them very welcoming. Our conversation got started with our introductions and uncle was very excited to know that I am from Assam as he spent most of his working days (40 years) in Assam. We chatted a lot about assamese food, especially fish.

Both uncle and aunty shared their health conditions. They showed me their medical test reports.

They came to know that I am a yoga instructor and showed keen interest in knowing more about yoga. 

I also got a chance to meet their daughters, Poonam and Neelam and their grandsons. I also met one of their son in law and discussed about the services which we provide. 
We also did a video call with Punam (our care leader).

Everyone is very comfortable with me as I noticed in my entire conversation with them. Aunty offered me tea and biscuits even though I said no to them. 

They said they will discuss with the daughters about how to plan the next visit and what help they would need. I told them in general how samarth helps. I gave them all the options. 

Hope and pray we have our next visit soon as I felt they need somebody along with them during their visit to the hospital.

My first family visit as care counselor was overwhelming and memorable. Thanks for the opportunity samarth.  and to Seema and Poonam to make it feasible for us as a team.",NOT URGENT,2025-06-06T15:54:09.295849+00:00

When we met Dr. Sahana, she examined Aunty and said that she suspects there is a cluster of veins behind the retina, and she wants to assess its condition. Because sometimes such clusters can have hemorrhages, leading to bleeding and loss of vision.

She said, ""It is my duty to preserve this vision,"" which is why they administer an injection every three months. But the exact condition can only be determined through an OCTA test.

OCTA is not covered under the CGHS panel and costs ‚Çπ2,500.

After the test, she showed me the report and explained how the cluster of veins is visible behind the retina. But as of now, there is no bleeding.

So she said that in order to maintain this condition, the injection will need to be given. She finalized the date as June 19 for the injection.

I have to go to CGHS to indent the injection, which I‚Äôll do next week.
