It was wonderful meeting aunty and both Rakhee& Doyel.
Aunty is doing well physically and in a phase of coping up with the new life situation. As of now she is doing great with both daughters around. Aunty spoke to me about her life old days, her kolkata connects and that she really wants to come here often but currently she wants to settle down first and then may be she is planning to visit US. I assure her that she will get our support as needed whenever she is here and need not wait for any urgency . Rather she should inform me before coming and I ll be there to receive her from airport.
Aunty asked about my whereabouts and in process we found quite a few common areas of interest. 
It was a warm and nice meeting. We spoke quite lot over cup of tea. 
Due to short span of their visit and lot to do, other visitors are lined up . So Rakhee wants to go out for something to buy . I know the place as aunty mentioned so I also came along with them and showed them the place and left.",not urgent,2025-06-18 12:18:08,2025-06-18 17:48:08

Agenda To take uncle to the eye clinic

Uncle's eye was swollen since10 days as he told me today, but it wasnt a big thing, thought he will be fine but It started irritating him 2 days back and water was cmng off n on so aunty asked him to visit the doctor.

I reached their house at 9.20 am and we took a cab till sringarnagar.
It was a nice hi tech OPD clinic with proper arrangements for patients.
It took two hours to go step by step to different doctors and it was diagnosed that the lower eye lid was folding inside due to loose skin n hair was irritating him n so the problem.so it has to be operated ASAP. 
So it was decided that surgery can be done tomorrow itself .
His blood test was conducted there itself.
So, we will be going at 1.45 pm tomorrow after lunch because 2.30 pm is the  surgery time.
