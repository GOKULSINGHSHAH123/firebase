His son is here and giving company even if he's busy.
He wished me good luck and gave blessings to my daughter for the upcoming future.",NOT URGENT,2025-06-07T03:03:10.165515+00:00

Purpose of visit well being of prantes 

Today I met aunty and uncle. Both of them were feeling fine. Aunty was at home, and uncle had gone t o Mall Road like he does every day. He also had some work at the bank, so he went there. While uncle was out, aunty and I did some exercise.

After exercising, aunty had to prepare lunch because her maid won‚Äôt be coming for two days ‚Äî she‚Äôs not feeling well. So aunty had to cook lunch herself. I helped her for a while, and then uncle came back. I spoke to uncle, and he said he got late today because he couldn‚Äôt find a taxi.

Aunty mentioned that her maid might go back to her village, but it‚Äôs not confirmed yet.",NOT URGENT,2025-06-07T03:02:19.125672+00:00

Aunty told me that when she goes to see the doctor she will get an X-ray done the same day, she is a little relieved with the medicines. Aunty is not getting physiotherapy done now because  therapist is charging a lot.",NOT URGENT,2025-06-07T03:41:04.010978+00:00
