They don‚Äôt understand how big of a help you all have been. It is ok, Mummy & Daisy are very happy with the services. so am I :)

I did tell my aunt that staff will visit as soon as my sister leaves & prepare medicines based on latest prescription.

but for the medicines, pls ask Daisy if pill box is easy or her original system of keeping 1 strip of each medicine in boxes labelled Morning etc is easier for her.

maybe Dr will change medicines again in a week or so.. then pill boxes might be difficult to use ",URGENT,2025-06-06T06:53:11.966289+00:00
