Agenda To take uncle to the eye clinic

Uncle's eye was swollen since10 days as he told me today, but it wasnt a big thing, thought he will be fine but It started irritating him 2 days back and water was cmng off n on so aunty asked him to visit the doctor.

I reached their house at 9.20 am and we took a cab till sringarnagar.
It was a nice hi tech OPD clinic with proper arrangements for patients.
It took two hours to go step by step to different doctors and it was diagnosed that the lower eye lid was folding inside due to loose skin n hair was irritating him n so the problem.so it has to be operated ASAP. 
So it was decided that surgery can be done tomorrow itself .
His blood test was conducted there itself.
So, we will be going at 1.45 pm tomorrow after lunch because 2.30 pm is the  surgery time.

Agenda To take uncle to the eye clinic

Uncle's eye was swollen since10 days as he told me today, but it wasnt a big thing, thought he will be fine but It started irritating him 2 days back and water was cmng off n on so aunty asked him to visit the doctor.

I reached their house at 9.20 am and we took a cab till sringarnagar.
It was a nice hi tech OPD clinic with proper arrangements for patients.
It took two hours to go step by step to different doctors and it was diagnosed that the lower eye lid was folding inside due to loose skin n hair was irritating him n so the problem.so it has to be operated ASAP. 
So it was decided that surgery can be done tomorrow itself .
His blood test was conducted there itself.
So, we will be going at 1.45 pm tomorrow after lunch because 2.30 pm is the  surgery time.

Visit time — 2.56 pm to 4.47 pm. 

Visit of the month — 3rd visit 

Summary —  It felt very good to meet Aunty today. aunty’s throat is better now. 
 Aunty was a little emotional today. She told me that she recently met uncle and her friend, and they also talked about uncle. 
Then she told me how she got married to uncle. Aunty told me that — I had just completed my college and was living in Masoore and my elder brother was living in Delhi, he called me to Delhi, then all the gentlemen came to see me. My elder sister-in-law got me ready , I wore a saree and At that time i did not even know who the groom was, then one person asked me some questions I gave answers but didn’t lift up my head , later I got to know he’s my would be husband. 
 after that aunty talked about her other sisters and brothers too . 
and then she told that uncle was ill and then uncle left,  aunty told me about the rituals which Mukul did and how he waited for Shalini
 (his sister )to come and then after he completed the Pooja and other ceremonies as well. 
while telling all this aunty got a bit emotional. 
After listening to all the things from aunty,   for a change , bcoz I didn’t want to see aunty getting more emotional….. so I asked aunty about her knitting, then aunty happily showed me what she was making, aunty said that she is not knitting from the last 2 days, she will do it slowly 
after that we did some activities like puzzles and making words as per the last time, aunty did it even better this time.
aunty liked it a lot, she said that this time it went well, she said I was able to write my name well this time . and aunty also made words from alphabets herself and wrote it too . 
I told aunty that we will practice this a little every time and it will get more better by time . 

Then Aunty told me that her son and daughter-in-law are going somewhere for a trip, 
so she will be going to her 2 sisters house for 1-2 days and she’s also planning to meet her old friend and after that she will stay at home for next 2-3 days, till then her daughter-in-law and son will return . 
I told Aunty that if she feels alone or need any help, she can call me anytime and I will come to meet her .
then Aunty said ,we will go out
 I have to buy some cotton unstitched suits, I have been thinking of buying them since quite a few days. 
So to know Aunty's preference I showed her some options online. 
Aunty liked the bandhani suit. 
Aunty said that I feel like going for shopping from Jaipur some day, there are very good suits available but Jaipur is very far, I cannot go there, so as of now will see from here.
Aunty told me that you should find out about cotton unstitched suits, so I told Aunty that okay aunty, you leave this to me, I will find out in advance, and then will take you with me then you can choose and we will purchase. 
lastly aunty feed me some halwa too .
as always it was delicious ☺️
aunty said my grandson come today so that’s why I made it for him .

I reached aunty’s house at 2:20 PM, booked a cab, and we reached the hospital on time.
We collected the prepaid consultation invoice and waited for our turn.
During the consultation, we informed the doctor that aunty has been feeling very anxious lately and that her stress levels have significantly increased.
We also mentioned that her bowel movements have been disturbed.
After reviewing all of aunty’s clinical blood reports and understanding our concerns, Dr. Vineet changed some of her medicines replacing a few and adding some new ones.
When asked about the increased uric acid and creatinine levels, the doctor said it is not alarming and could be due to stress. He advised aunty to get her latest urine reports done and follow up in 10 days.
After the consultation, I booked a cab and we returned home.
Upon reaching, I marked the new medicines for her.
Aunty was also facing some issues with the Tata Sky Play Guide, so I helped her understand and use it more efficiently.

Purpose of visit well being of parents 

---

Today, I went to meet Aunty and Uncle. Both Aunty and Uncle are doing well. Uncle had gone to Mall Road, so in the meantime, Aunty and I did a bit of exercise. We exercised for about 30  minutes. After that, Aunty’s maid arrived, and by then, Uncle had also returned.

But Uncle is facing a lot of trouble getting a taxi. He couldn’t find one in the morning either — he had to walk halfway and then take a taxi for the rest. Today as well, he walked halfway and then took a taxi. The traffic police stopped the taxi driver for a challan (fine), but fortunately, he wasn’t fined today.

When Uncle got home, he said the traffic police are troubling them a lot. Then Aunty told me that if possible, I should talk to someone about it. So, on my way back, I first spoke to some taxi drivers near the sweets shop. They said the police are indeed bothering them a lot — one driver even said he had to pay a fine of ₹3000 last time, as they often stop taxis.

Then I spoke to the traffic police officers nearby. They told me I should first go to the traffic office and find out, or I might need to get a proper permission. After coming down from there, I asked another officer on duty, and he said, “Ma'am, we can’t do anything. You’ll have to go to the DC office for this.”

So, I’ll go tomorrow and try to find out more.",urgent,2025-06-18 14:19:59,2025-06-18 19:49:59

I went to Dr Piyush Jalota's clinic with uncle. The doctor observed uncle and listened to his problems very patiently. 
The doctor did a physical checkup of the uncle. The doctor said that the uncle's arm pain is due to a frozen shoulder. He asked the uncle to do daily exercises. The doctor told the uncle some exercises which he has to do daily.
The doctor examined the uncle's walk. The doctor said that there is no specific reason. Uncle is very fit according to his age, The pain is due to sitting in the same position continuously  & lack of exercise. He has prescribed some medicines which will give relief to the uncle from the pain. 
The doctor has said that you can get exercises done by a physiotherapist for a few days and then do it yourself later. The doctor has also given the number of a physiotherapist.
I have given the medicines to uncle.

Further, after an ultrasound, aunty could not show report to doctor as he had left.

As per blood report, the doctor has given tablets for sodium.
