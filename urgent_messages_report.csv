265375a1-7e78-47a4-be5e-656134bdb2f9,Vimala Natarajan / Natarajan Sukumar,"Spoke to my mom last night.  It appears that Swati has changed her schedule after convincing Suman to modify her schedule and it has left my mom without an attendant for sometime.  Suman tends to comply with what is asked of her and cannot say “no”.  Swati told my mom that she will come at 9 am and leave at 6 pm.  But this is less than the 10 hrs previously agreed to and it is not the times we asked for.  Moreover Suman is not able to reach home by 6 pm - it is too early for her.  It appears that Swati wants to give tuitions in the evening.  If this gap will  continue I suggest need a plan B since my mom may have an emergency or even fall ill and/or may not be in a position to attend to the door when no one is at home. If so need a few options:

1. If Swati cannot meet the original time we agreed upon ask the agency  to find someone else  

2. Ask them to find 2 attendants if 1 for the whole duration is not possible with Swati being there from 1030 am to 5 pm and someone else from 5 pm to 8 pm. 

3.  Or some other option.  ",URGENT,2025-06-07T04:31:54.480856+00:00
