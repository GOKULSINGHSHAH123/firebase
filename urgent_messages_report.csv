Visited aunty and Cor. As soon as i reached AC technician was also there. He thoroughly checked all the Ac's and the main unit for all the Ac's. He first checked with all the ac's on and then checked with only one AC  on. All seemed to be fine. Its that he explained few things to be kept in mind and specially to put off the AC if the main light goes off because if we use AC with back up light the charge is 28 per unit as compared to normal 7 per unit and main unit needs to get serviced too along with AC servicing.

When we met Dr. Sahana, she examined Aunty and said that she suspects there is a cluster of veins behind the retina, and she wants to assess its condition. Because sometimes such clusters can have hemorrhages, leading to bleeding and loss of vision.

She said, ""It is my duty to preserve this vision,"" which is why they administer an injection every three months. But the exact condition can only be determined through an OCTA test.

OCTA is not covered under the CGHS panel and costs ‚Çπ2,500.

After the test, she showed me the report and explained how the cluster of veins is visible behind the retina. But as of now, there is no bleeding.

So she said that in order to maintain this condition, the injection will need to be given. She finalized the date as June 19 for the injection.

I have to go to CGHS to indent the injection, which I‚Äôll do next week.
