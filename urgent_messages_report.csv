I think we had agreed that for now apart from Omveer we will not have any Samarth folk interact directly with my parents. Lets keep it like that till after we  have Dr. Dhamne recommendations. 

My parents can go to the appointment themselves. Hinduja khar is close to our home.  I was not expecting  anyone to accompany my parents to this appointment.  So please do not postpone it.

I spoke with Aunty ji yesterday. Her blood pressure was low, so she had coffee and chocolate, which helped. However, she got tired due to Nirjala ekadshi today and various chores, including helping the blind school  and pandtani jiwith grocery demands. The sever got filled from the backside, and she had the keys. Her low BP also prevented her from attending satsang. I also talked to Kaushalya Masi ji, who will be taking Aunty ji to her house on Sunday, June 8th, and she have to consult to orthopedic doctor check-up. Aunty ji is finding it challenging to manage without Anita, who is currently unwell with a plaster on her right shoulder and hasn't confirmed when she'll return. I tried calling Anita multiple times to offer condolences for her husband's passing, but her phone isn't receiving incoming calls. Aunty ji will stay with her sister until Anita returns. I'll visit tomorrow morning to meet Kaushalya Aunty ji, as she's been calling me.",URGENT,2025-06-06T13:32:01.004909+00:00
