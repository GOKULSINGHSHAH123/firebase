Purpose - Dr Anshul home visit to review urin√© report, collect medical bills for reimbursement, Bank work and eye glass change for aunty 

Uncle called Dr. Anshul to check his urine report, uncle feels a lot of pain while urinating, uncle has infection and for that he has started IV for seven days. After that made a list of medicines to order and checked the medicine stock, Sanjeev is going on leave from 10th for 20 days so uncle wants to order all medicines for a month. Checked uncle's passbook and sent the driver to update the passbook, unfortunately uncle did not get his new passbook and the bank refused to give the statement, then I checked uncle's phone and I got a message of medical reimbursement which was shown to uncle and aunty. In the bank they said they need an application to issue a new passbook, so I told uncle to check once again otherwise I will go to the bank with the application next time.",URGENT,2025-06-06T16:02:55.686759+00:00

Date: 05/06/2025
Time : 10:30 am - 12:30 pm 

I met uncle and aunty yesterday and found them very welcoming. Our conversation got started with our introductions and uncle was very excited to know that I am from Assam as he spent most of his working days (40 years) in Assam. We chatted a lot about assamese food, especially fish.

Both uncle and aunty shared their health conditions. They showed me their medical test reports.

They came to know that I am a yoga instructor and showed keen interest in knowing more about yoga. 

I also got a chance to meet their daughters, Poonam and Neelam and their grandsons. I also met one of their son in law and discussed about the services which we provide. 
We also did a video call with Punam (our care leader).

Everyone is very comfortable with me as I noticed in my entire conversation with them. Aunty offered me tea and biscuits even though I said no to them. 

They said they will discuss with the daughters about how to plan the next visit and what help they would need. I told them in general how samarth helps. I gave them all the options. 

Hope and pray we have our next visit soon as I felt they need somebody along with them during their visit to the hospital.

My first family visit as care counselor was overwhelming and memorable. Thanks for the opportunity samarth.  and to Seema and Poonam to make it feasible for us as a team.",NOT URGENT,2025-06-06T15:54:09.295849+00:00
