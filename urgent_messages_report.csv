Second visit of the month 
Taking aunty to Cardiologist 
Reached Fortis Escorts and met uncle and aunty . Completed the paper work and met Dr Vijay Kumar . He checked aunty and told her that the BP fluctuations was due to anxiety and restlessness due to loose motions and stomach issues and nothing serious . As that has subsided she is coming to normal now . He has advised consultation with neurologist for her dizziness . I checked up with the hospital as the neurologist head of the department is out of India and will be back after 10th and then uncle will take the appointment and I will accompany them . Rest all is fine",URGENT,2025-06-06T19:18:37.208536+00:00
